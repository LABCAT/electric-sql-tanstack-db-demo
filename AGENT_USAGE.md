# Copy-Paste Prompt for Cursor Background Agent

```
Implement the next uncompleted task from .kiro/specs/flight-timetable/tasks.md

Find the first task marked with - [ ] and implement it completely.

Project: Flight timetable app with real-time collaboration (like Figma)
Tech stack: React + Vite + TypeScript + Tamagui + TanStack DB + Electric SQL + Drizzle + Supabase
Node version: 24 (see .nvmrc)

This is a fresh project - create all necessary files and configurations.

Reference these files for context:
- .kiro/specs/flight-timetable/requirements.md (user requirements)
- .kiro/specs/flight-timetable/design.md (technical architecture)  
- .kiro/specs/flight-timetable/tasks.md (implementation tasks)
- package.json (existing dependencies list)

When complete:
1. Mark task done: change - [ ] to - [x] in tasks.md
2. Create PR with title "Task X.Y: [task description]"
3. Ensure everything works (no errors, builds successfully)
